		<div class="sidebar"><p id="notop">In 2001, Bungee revolutionized first-person gaming with the Halo series. Storied franchises such as Call of Duty were quick to mimic their rival's formula. Almost two decades later, nothing has changed. The video game industry has stagnated. Today, the top selling games have become indistinguishable from their rivals. 

							  Our answer to this decay. Snake with Yo Face

							  An almost immersive experience. Snake with Yo Face places you, the user, in the world of the classic video game, Snake. Butt heads with your friends and learn to be the snake as you control the game only using your face.  The player controls the first-person point-of-view game with a combination of head turns and facial gestures. Using the Muse headband's built-in accelerometer, the game tracks the motion of the player's head to direct the snake on screen. </p>
